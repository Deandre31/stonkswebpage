        <h2 style="text-align: center;">WHAT IS A STOCK?</h2>
        <p>A stock (also called share or equity) represents ownership in a company. When you purchase a stock, you are buying a small portion of the company, which makes you a shareholder. Stocks are typically issued by companies to raise capital for business operations, expansion, and other needs.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">WHY ARE STOCKS IMPORTANT?</h2>
        <p>1. Capital Raising for Companies(IPOS)-When a company issues stock (through an initial public offering or IPO), it raises capital without incurring debt. This capital can be used for expanding operations, developing new products, entering new markets, or funding research and development.</p>
        <p>2.Economic indicator-Stock market indices like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq serve as important barometers of overall economic health </p>
        <p>3.Wealth creation/retirement plan-Stocks allow individual investors, including everyday people, to invest in the growth of successful companies, creating opportunities for wealth accumulation. This is especially important for people looking to save for retirement.</p>
